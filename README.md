# Git Basics Assignment – Reflection

## What I Learned
Through this assignment, I practiced the fundamental operations of Git and GitHub, including:
- Initializing repositories and creating commits.
- Working with branches and switching between them.
- Merging branches into the main branch.
- Creating intentional merge conflicts and resolving them.
- Using Git log graphs and understanding commit history visually.
- Adding files such as text documents and screenshots to the repo.
- Writing meaningful commit messages and maintaining clean history.

I gained a much clearer understanding of how branching works and why merge conflicts happen.  
Seeing a conflict in a real situation helped me understand how to resolve one manually by choosing which lines to keep.

## Feedback / Thoughts
- This assignment was very helpful because it forced me to practice real Git workflows instead of only reading about them.
- Creating conflicts on purpose made the learning process more realistic.
- I feel more confident now working with branches and merging.
- If anything, I would like extra practice scenarios involving rebase, stash, or handling more complex conflicts.

Overall, this assignment helped solidify my Git fundamentals and gave me practical skills that I will definitely use in real projects.
